# AngularJS and MandrillApp

Sending e-mail by Mandrill App with AngularJS.

## Getting Started

1. Add your API KEY in `./js/app.js` file
2. Add your receiving information in `./js/services/AppService.js` as e-mail, name and subject

## Dependencies

It uses bootstrap and ladda button as well. Do not worry, cdn works like a charm, but if you care about just take `./js` stuff.
